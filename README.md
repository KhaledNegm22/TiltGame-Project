# TiltGame-Project
The Tilt Puzzle Game involves sliding pieces on an \( n \times n \) grid by tilting the board in four directions. The goal is to move a slider onto a target square, navigating around obstacles and other sliders.
This project focuses on modeling the board, simulating slider movements, and finding the optimal sequence of tilts to solve the puzzle.
For more details take a look at the project explanation folder.
